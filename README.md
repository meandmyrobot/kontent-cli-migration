# Kentico Kontent CLI - Migration Example
Howdy :wave:. This project is a companion repo to [an article I wrote on dev.to](https://dev.to/meandmyrobot/migrating-model-changes-with-the-kentico-kontent-cli-2iba). The article will walk you through exactly what's going - so please [check it out](https://dev.to/meandmyrobot/migrating-model-changes-with-the-kentico-kontent-cli-2iba). It's all about using the Kentico Kontent CLI to migrate model changes. [Kentico Kontent](https://kontent.ai/?utm_source=medium_content_modelling_series_part1&utm_medium=mvp_94301&utm_campaign=extended_trial
) is a fantastic headless CMS. If you sign up by going to the site via [this link](https://kontent.ai/?utm_source=medium_content_modelling_series_part1&utm_medium=mvp_94301&utm_campaign=extended_trial
) then you'll get an extended trial.

If you're using this repo, then you don't have to follow all the steps that ask you to register dependencies or create the JavaScript files. You do need to install the dependencies. You can do this by running the following in your command window or terminal (in the project folder):

```shell
npm i
```
